# DrumSampler Recording Feature

This feature allows users to record audio directly from their microphone and add it to the DrumSampler module.

## How to Use

1. Click on a pad to select it
2. In the editor panel, click the "Record" button

5. Click "Stop" when finished
6. The recorded audio will be loaded into the selected pad

## Requirements

- A microphone connected to your computer
- Browser permission to access the microphone

## Technical Implementation

The recording feature works by:

1. Using the MediaDevices.getUserMedia() API to access the microphone
2. Creating a MediaRecorder instance to capture the audio
3. Processing the recorded audio data into an AudioBuffer
4. Storing the buffer in the sampler's audio buffer array
5. Updating the pad display and waveform visualization

## Tips for Good Recordings

- Use a decent quality microphone for best results
- Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise
- Keep a consistent distance from the microphone
- For percussion sounds, make sure the attack is clear and immediate
- Trim long silences at the beginning or end for tighter timing

## Privacy

All recordings are processed locally in your browser. No audio data is sent to any server.
